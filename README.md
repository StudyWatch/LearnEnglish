🎬 StudyWatch - Learn Languages Through TV Shows
📖 Project Overview
StudyWatch is an interactive language-learning platform designed to help users learn English (and additional languages in the future) by watching TV series. The platform enables users to study 15 new words per episode, see them in context, and then practice their understanding through engaging games and exercises.

🚀 Key Features
✅ Learn Words from TV Shows – The system extracts key words from each episode, providing translations and real-world examples.
✅ Quiz & Game-Based Learning – Users reinforce their knowledge through interactive quizzes and challenges.
✅ Multi-Language Support – Currently supports English and Hebrew, with plans to expand to Spanish, Russian, Arabic, and Portuguese.
✅ Private & Group Lessons – Integrated Zoom-based learning with affordable pricing.
✅ AI-Driven Content Optimization – Ensures word variety between episodes to avoid redundancy.
✅ Mobile-Friendly Design – A clean and minimalistic UI for an optimal user experience, especially on mobile devices.
